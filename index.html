              <h3>Sim2Real Project</h3>
              <p>
              This project focused on sim-to-real transfer for robotic control using NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab. I developed a digital twin of the UR3 robotic arm and the Robotiq 2F-85mm gripper in Isaac Sim, integrated with Isaac Lab for reinforcement learning (RL). Through this setup, I gained hands-on experience in training an RL policy using a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in Python to perform a pick-and-place task.</p>
              <p class="mb-4">
                The trained reward-based policy successfully demonstrated the target behavior in simulation. While partially successful in real-world deployment, I identified opportunities for improvement through advanced techniques such as dual-policy architectures or imitation learning to enhance policy performance and generalization.
                </p>
              <p class="mb-4">
                    For deployment, the trained policy would be transferred from simulation to the physical robot using the joint observations as well as ROS to interface to the UR3. Due to location between the robot and simulation I could not achieve a direct interface from simulation to the robot. 
                    Instead I opted to develop TCP socket communication method to communicate between the simulation pc (client) and to the a device (server) to connect to the robot itself remotely using TCP sockets over a VPN. This led to successful control over the physical robot itself using my trained policy. A video example can be found in the repository.
                  </p>

              <h3>Isaac Braccio</h3>
              <p>
               This is a new project that I have started to work on involving the tinkerkit Braccio robot arm: https://store.arduino.cc/products/tinkerkit-braccio-robot. I've built the physical model which can be controlled using an Arduino UNO.
                  </p>
              </p>
              <p class="mb-4">
                   I developed a digital twin of the Isaac Braccio using the available CAD files. There the joints were abled to be controlled and the model is now compatible in Isaac Lab. I plan to incorporate some of the Isaac Sim ecosystem for this model such as Isaac Lab to perform robot learning. Morover, using
                   Isaac Sim/Lab I wish to acheive a form of teleoperation with the physical device.

              <h3>Piano Exoskeleton Hand</h3>
              <p>
              This group project focused on the development and business design of an exoskeleton hand aimed at enhancing piano teaching. The system functioned by using a master glove to monitor a userâ€™s finger movements, which were then wirelessly mirrored by a slave exoskeleton hand, providing real-time motion replication for educational or assistive purposes.
              </p>
                  <p class="mb-4">
                    On the technical side, we utilized Arduino microcontrollers to drive the actuation system. My role involved establishing a local wireless communication network between the master and slave devices and integrating the various technical subsystems developed by team members into a cohesive, functioning prototype.

                  <p class="mb-4">
                    In addition to my technical responsibilities, I led the commercial viability analysis of the product. This included market research, competitive analysis, and outlining a potential business model to assess the feasibility of bringing the product to market.

              <p>As part of my degree, I completed a year-long industrial placement at ATLAS ELEKTRONIK UK, where I gained valuable experience in both software development and industrial control systems. I was introduced to PLC concepts and ladder logic, which broadened my understanding of embedded and automation systems.</p>
                  <p class="mb-6">
                    In the software domain, I worked on both individual and team-based projects. As part of a collaborative environment with other placement students, we followed Agile methodology, using sprints to iteratively design, develop, and refine software solutions from the ground up. We regularly conducted presentations to showcase our progress and outcomes to stakeholders and technical leads.

                  <p class="mb-6">
                   I was also responsible for a project handover, ensuring the smooth transition of ongoing work to future developers. I focused on maintaining clean code practices, writing clear and thorough documentation, and supporting knowledge transfer within the team to enhance continuity and collaboration.
